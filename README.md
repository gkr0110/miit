Welcome to the repository of MIIT - the Multiomics Imaging Integration Toolset.

At the moment this is only the initial code. Over the next 2-4 weeks the following features will be added (i.e. until the middle of July).

These include:
- Proper installation
- Code cleaup to remove/move dependencies.
- Documentation and tutorial.


TODOS:

- Test registerers and remove registerers that dont make sense anymore.
- Make sure that MolecularImagingData loader is used and test extendability (global objects?)
- Test groupwise registration.
- Document at least most important functions/classes.
- Write tutorial.
- Make installation script.
- Read the docs.
